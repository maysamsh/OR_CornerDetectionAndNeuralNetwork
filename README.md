# OR_CornerDetectionAndNeuralNetwork
The Harris corner detector is a popular interest point detector due to its strong invariance to: rotation, scale, illumination variation and image noise. The Harris corner detector is based on the local auto-correlation function of a signal; where the local auto-correlation function measures the local changes of the signal with patches shifted by a small amount in different directions. In this paper, with the approach of corner detection system, Harris, we create a specification vector from the entry image that include the color of the pixel from the eight key neighborhoods in the color space, HSV .This specification vector transform to a fifty column histogram and feeds a neural network which will use it for classifying the entry images.
